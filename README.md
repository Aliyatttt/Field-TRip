# Field-TRip
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1245154322

In my scratch project, the early college people are attending a field trip to a concert.

I used a loop to make the sprites keep dancing and moving

I used a conditional statement to make the audience respond to the musicians

I switched backdrops to change the scenerios

My custom block is my dance block which i made with different costumes

I hid some sprited based on their responsibilities for each backdrop
